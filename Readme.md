# AORTS Java Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for the 2019 AO RTS, built with Java. It includes:

 - simple AI that randomly walks units around
 - unit test project with a couple examples
 - IntelliJ configuration for build/test/debug

## Get Started

- Install Java 12
- Check out this repo, then open it in IntelliJ.
- You should be able to execute the code with Build->Debug

## What's next?

- Take a look at the UnitStrategyFactory.
- See if you can improve the exploration strategy! The random moves it's currently making are not a great way to explore the map.
- Try to collect resources to increase your score and ability to build units.
- Maybe create a strategy to build some units?
- Consider an offensive strategy! You can win by blowing up your opponent's base, or you can weaken your opponent by destroying their units.
